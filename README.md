# 👋 Hey, I'm Austin

Passionate Frontend Engineer based in Chicago, IL, with a knack for creating seamless and intuitive user experiences. Over the past three years, I've honed my skills in diverse settings, contributing to the success of e-commerce and SaaS startups, thriving in dynamic agency environments, and making a mark through independent contracting.

When I'm not coding or staying updated on the latest tech trends, you'll find me immersed in my other love – music. I enjoy spending my time playing guitar and collaborating with others in my band. The creative process, whether in coding or music, fuels my passion, and I'm always excited about opportunities to bring innovative ideas to life through collaboration.
